# OS-Bankers-Algorithm
This project implements the Banker's Algorithm, a deadlock avoidance method in operating systems. It simulates resource allocation among processes while ensuring the system remains in a safe state. Users can enter the number of processes and resources, and the algorithm checks for safe allocation.
